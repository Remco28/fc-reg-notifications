[2025-08-26 09:00] [Gemini]: SETUP: Initialized comms directory structure and logging protocol.
[2025-09-25 00:00:00] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY - 2025-09-25-scraper-fencingtracker.md
[2025-09-25T21:31Z] [TECHADVISOR]: ADVISORY NOTES: Fencing Club Registration Notifications
- Good: Component list covers scraper→notify flow while keeping stack Pythonic/simple (comms/planning/2025-09-25-initial-planning.md:10).
- Risk (med): v0 scope spans two scrapers, email pipeline, scheduler, and UI before validating data extraction → Action: lock first milestone to fencingtracker connector + persistence + change detection; backlog askfred + web UI until notifications work (comms/planning/2025-09-25-initial-planning.md:10).
- Risk (med): Plan doesn't define how registrations map to DB entities or how new/updated rows are detected → Action: draft lightweight data model (clubs, fencers, tournaments, registrations) with unique keys and last_seen_at, and outline diffing strategy that prevents duplicate emails (comms/planning/2025-09-25-initial-planning.md:11).
- Risk (low): Email notifications unspecified (transport, sender auth, local dev experience) → Action: pick provider or interim SMTP strategy, capture env vars/secrets handling, and note retry/quiet hours (comms/planning/2025-09-25-initial-planning.md:12).
- Question: Any constraints on scrape frequency / robots.txt compliance or rate limits we need to respect?
[2025-09-25T21:45Z] [DEVELOPER]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Implementing core data pipeline for fencingtracker.com (Tournament/Fencer/Registration models, CRUD operations, and scraper service)
[2025-09-25T22:00Z] [DEVELOPER]: IMPL DONE: Core data pipeline implemented and tested - Tournament/Fencer/Registration models with unique constraints, CRUD operations with get_or_create pattern, scraper service with change detection, database initialization. All acceptance criteria met.
[2025-09-26 00:00:00] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY - 2025-09-26-notification-service.md

[2025-09-26T10:00Z] [DEVELOPER]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Implementing email notification service (SMTP configuration, notification service, integration with scraper)

[2025-09-26T10:30Z] [DEVELOPER]: IMPL DONE: Email notification service implemented and tested - SMTP configuration via .env, notification service with smtplib, integrated with scraper for new registration alerts, environment loading in main.py. Fixed CRUD flush issue for architect's commit pattern. All acceptance criteria met.

[2025-09-26T11:00Z] [ARCHITECT]: REVIEW PASS - Notification service implementation meets specification; spec archived.
[2025-09-29T16:34Z] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY - 2025-09-29-mailgun-email-helper.md
[2025-09-29T16:45Z] [DEVELOPER]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Implementing Mailgun email notification helper (client, service updates, CLI command, tests, docs)
[2025-09-29T17:15Z] [DEVELOPER]: IMPL DONE: Mailgun email notification helper implemented - MailgunEmailClient with retry logic and configuration validation, notification service updated with new send_registration_notification function, scraper service integrated, send-test-email CLI command added, documentation updated, comprehensive unit tests added. All acceptance criteria met.
[2025-09-29T17:30Z] [DEVELOPER]: BUGFIX: Fixed timeout enforcement in MailgunEmailClient - timeout parameter now properly passed to session.post() calls instead of setting session.timeout (which requests ignores). Added test coverage for timeout enforcement. Issue identified by architect at mailgun_client.py:96.
[2025-09-29T18:37Z] [ARCHITECT]: REVIEW PASS - Mailgun helper spec implemented; task archived.
[2025-09-30T10:00Z] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY - 2025-09-30-web-ui.md
[2025-09-30T10:15Z] [DEVELOPER]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Implementing web UI for registration monitoring (Jinja2 templates, query service, HTML endpoints)
[2025-09-30T11:00Z] [DEVELOPER]: IMPL DONE: Web UI for registration monitoring implemented and tested - registration_query_service with filtering/sorting, Jinja2 templates (base.html, registrations.html), GET / HTML endpoint with filters and sorting controls, GET /registrations/json API endpoint, responsive design with Pico CSS, relative time formatting for last seen dates, mobile-friendly layout. All acceptance criteria met.
[2025-09-30T13:40Z] [ARCHITECT]: REVIEW PASS - Web UI implementation meets all 15 acceptance criteria; exceeds spec with relative time formatting. Task archived.
[2025-09-30T14:00Z] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY - 2025-09-30-scraper-enhancements.md
[2025-09-30T14:15Z] [DEVELOPER]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Implementing scraper enhancements (HTTP retry logic, URL normalization, table parsing fixes, error handling)
[2025-09-30T15:00Z] [DEVELOPER]: IMPL DONE: Scraper enhancements implemented and tested - normalize_club_url function with URL validation and normalization, retry logic with exponential backoff (1s/2s/4s), proper User-Agent headers, corrected table parsing for fencingtracker.com structure (Name→Fencer, Event→Tournament, Status→events, Date→tournament_date), structured logging with attempt counts and error details, 4xx errors fail immediately without retry, 5xx errors retry with backoff. Successfully tested with real fencingtracker.com URLs. All acceptance criteria met.
[2025-09-30T15:15Z] [ARCHITECT]: REVIEW PASS - Scraper enhancements meet all 14 acceptance criteria; successfully tested with Elite FC URL (6 registrations scraped). URL normalization, retry logic, and table parsing all verified. Task archived.
[2025-09-30T15:30Z] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY - 2025-09-30-tournament-grouping-fix.md
[2025-09-30T15:45Z] [DEVELOPER]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Implementing tournament grouping parser fix (h3 heading parsing, tournament section loop, correct field mapping)
[2025-09-30T16:30Z] [DEVELOPER]: IMPL DONE: Tournament grouping parser fix implemented and tested - scraper now finds all h3 tournament headings (18 on Elite FC page), uses nested loop to process each tournament section + table, correctly maps heading text to Tournament.name and table column 1 to Registration.events, handles multiple events per fencer in same tournament by comma-separating in events field, enhanced CRUD layer with IntegrityError handling for concurrent updates, added tournament context to all log messages. Successfully scraped 94 registrations across 18 tournaments from Elite FC URL. All acceptance criteria met.
[2025-09-30T16:45Z] [ARCHITECT]: REVIEW PASS - Tournament grouping fix meets all 15 acceptance criteria; verified 94 registrations across 18 tournaments with correct field mappings (Tournament.name from h3 headings, Registration.events from table columns). Smart enhancement: multiple events per fencer comma-separated. Task archived.
[2025-10-01T12:15Z] [DEVELOPER]: BUGFIX: Updated scraper heading heuristics to skip club metadata headings like "(Elite FC)" and "Tournaments", avoid duplicate processing, and added unit coverage for the new filters. Verified via pytest and live scrape against Elite FC URL (16 tournaments, 86 registrations, no duplicates). Documentation refreshed to capture the scraper behavior.
