[2025-08-26 09:00] [Gemini]: SETUP: Initialized comms directory structure and logging protocol.
[2025-09-25 00:00:00] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY - 2025-09-25-scraper-fencingtracker.md
[2025-09-25T21:31Z] [TECHADVISOR]: ADVISORY NOTES: Fencing Club Registration Notifications
- Good: Component list covers scraper→notify flow while keeping stack Pythonic/simple (comms/planning/2025-09-25-initial-planning.md:10).
- Risk (med): v0 scope spans two scrapers, email pipeline, scheduler, and UI before validating data extraction → Action: lock first milestone to fencingtracker connector + persistence + change detection; backlog askfred + web UI until notifications work (comms/planning/2025-09-25-initial-planning.md:10).
- Risk (med): Plan doesn't define how registrations map to DB entities or how new/updated rows are detected → Action: draft lightweight data model (clubs, fencers, tournaments, registrations) with unique keys and last_seen_at, and outline diffing strategy that prevents duplicate emails (comms/planning/2025-09-25-initial-planning.md:11).
- Risk (low): Email notifications unspecified (transport, sender auth, local dev experience) → Action: pick provider or interim SMTP strategy, capture env vars/secrets handling, and note retry/quiet hours (comms/planning/2025-09-25-initial-planning.md:12).
- Question: Any constraints on scrape frequency / robots.txt compliance or rate limits we need to respect?
[2025-09-25T21:45Z] [DEVELOPER]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Implementing core data pipeline for fencingtracker.com (Tournament/Fencer/Registration models, CRUD operations, and scraper service)
[2025-09-25T22:00Z] [DEVELOPER]: IMPL DONE: Core data pipeline implemented and tested - Tournament/Fencer/Registration models with unique constraints, CRUD operations with get_or_create pattern, scraper service with change detection, database initialization. All acceptance criteria met.
[2025-09-26 00:00:00] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY - 2025-09-26-notification-service.md

[2025-09-26T10:00Z] [DEVELOPER]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Implementing email notification service (SMTP configuration, notification service, integration with scraper)

[2025-09-26T10:30Z] [DEVELOPER]: IMPL DONE: Email notification service implemented and tested - SMTP configuration via .env, notification service with smtplib, integrated with scraper for new registration alerts, environment loading in main.py. Fixed CRUD flush issue for architect's commit pattern. All acceptance criteria met.

[2025-09-26T11:00Z] [ARCHITECT]: REVIEW PASS - Notification service implementation meets specification; spec archived.
[2025-09-29T16:34Z] [ARCHITECT]: SPEC READY - 2025-09-29-mailgun-email-helper.md
[2025-09-29T16:45Z] [DEVELOPER]: IMPL IN_PROGRESS: Implementing Mailgun email notification helper (client, service updates, CLI command, tests, docs)
[2025-09-29T17:15Z] [DEVELOPER]: IMPL DONE: Mailgun email notification helper implemented - MailgunEmailClient with retry logic and configuration validation, notification service updated with new send_registration_notification function, scraper service integrated, send-test-email CLI command added, documentation updated, comprehensive unit tests added. All acceptance criteria met.
[2025-09-29T17:30Z] [DEVELOPER]: BUGFIX: Fixed timeout enforcement in MailgunEmailClient - timeout parameter now properly passed to session.post() calls instead of setting session.timeout (which requests ignores). Added test coverage for timeout enforcement. Issue identified by architect at mailgun_client.py:96.
[2025-09-29T18:37Z] [ARCHITECT]: REVIEW PASS - Mailgun helper spec implemented; task archived.
