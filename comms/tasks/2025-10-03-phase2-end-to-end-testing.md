# Phase 2 End-to-End Testing Session
**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Status:** COMPLETED
**Tester:** Product Owner (frank)
**Session Type:** Live production readiness validation

---

## Session Summary

Conducted comprehensive end-to-end testing of Phase 2 tracked fencer functionality with real user workflows. Discovered and resolved multiple critical bugs in database schema, URL handling, form processing, and scraper logic.

---

## Test Environment Setup

### Initial State
- **Branch:** `main` (after merging `singlefencertracking`)
- **Database:** SQLite at `fc_registration.db`
- **Migration Status:** f8a8c6bdf3d7 (latest)
- **Test User:** frank (ID: 1, admin, frankcng@gmail.com)
- **Mailgun:** Configured and operational

### Environment Variables Added
```bash
# Added to .env during testing
ADMIN_EMAIL=frankcng@gmail.com
```

---

## Critical Issues Discovered & Fixed

### Issue 1: Database Schema Out of Sync ❌ → ✅

**Problem:**
Database was created before Alembic adoption. Running `alembic stamp head` marked it as current without applying schema changes. Missing columns caused runtime errors:
```
sqlite3.OperationalError: no such column: registrations.club_url
```

**Root Cause:**
- Old database from pre-Alembic era
- `alembic stamp head` only updates version table, doesn't migrate schema
- Registrations table missing: `club_url`, `created_at` columns

**Resolution:**
```bash
# Backup and recreate database
cp fc_registration.db fc_registration.db.pre-migration-fix
rm fc_registration.db
alembic upgrade head
```

**Lesson Learned:**
- Never use `alembic stamp` on databases created outside Alembic
- Always verify schema with actual column inspection, not just version stamps
- Include schema verification in deployment checklist

**Files Modified:** None (operational fix)

---

### Issue 2: Fencer Profile URLs Missing Name Slug ❌ → ✅

**Problem:**
Fencer profile links returned 404 errors. URLs were generated as:
```
https://fencingtracker.com/p/100349376  ❌ (404)
```

But fencingtracker.com requires:
```
https://fencingtracker.com/p/100349376/Jake-Mann  ✅
```

**Root Cause:**
`build_fencer_profile_url()` accepted a `name_slug` parameter but ignored it with comment "not used in URL construction"

**Resolution:**
Modified `app/services/fencer_validation_service.py:137-155`:
```python
def build_fencer_profile_url(fencer_id: str, name_slug: Optional[str] = None) -> str:
    if name_slug:
        # Convert to URL-safe slug format (replace spaces with dashes, etc.)
        slug = name_slug.strip().replace(" ", "-")
        return f"https://www.fencingtracker.com/p/{fencer_id}/{slug}"

    # Fallback: URL without slug (may result in 404 on fencingtracker)
    return f"https://www.fencingtracker.com/p/{fencer_id}"
```

Updated callers to pass `display_name`:
- `app/api/tracked_fencers.py:81` - Pass `fencer.display_name`
- `app/services/fencer_scraper_service.py:200` - Pass `display_name` parameter

**Lesson Learned:**
- Fencingtracker.com requires slug in URL for profile pages
- Display name is critical for URL generation, not just UI display

**Files Modified:**
- `app/services/fencer_validation_service.py`
- `app/api/tracked_fencers.py`
- `app/services/fencer_scraper_service.py`

---

### Issue 3: Tracked Fencer Form Not Saving Display Name ❌ → ✅

**Problem:**
When adding fencer by ID with display name entered in form, the display name wasn't saved to database. Record showed `display_name: None`.

**Root Cause:**
Form processing logic in `app/api/tracked_fencers.py:155` used pattern:
```python
display_name = (form.get("display_name") or "").strip() or None
```

This worked correctly, but the real issue was that the form workflow was too complex:
1. Accept numeric ID OR URL
2. Try to extract slug from input
3. Derive display name from slug
4. If no slug, try cache
5. If no cache, scrape for name
6. Use user-provided display name as override

Too many code paths led to bugs.

**Resolution:**
**Simplified to URL-only input** - removed display name field entirely:
- Users MUST provide full fencingtracker URL
- Display name is auto-extracted from URL slug
- No more manual ID entry (was unreliable)

Modified files:
- `app/templates/partials/tracked_fencers_card.html:22-33` - Removed display_name field
- `app/api/tracked_fencers.py:153-175` - Extract name from URL slug only
- `app/api/tracked_fencers.py:217-225` - Simplified fallback logic

**New Form Fields:**
```html
1. Fencer profile URL (required) - e.g., https://fencingtracker.com/p/100235805/Nicholas-Iarikov
2. Weapons (optional) - e.g., foil,epee,saber
```

**Lesson Learned:**
- Simpler UX = fewer bugs
- Don't give users multiple ways to do the same thing
- Auto-extraction from URLs is more reliable than manual entry

**Files Modified:**
- `app/templates/partials/tracked_fencers_card.html`
- `app/api/tracked_fencers.py`

---

### Issue 4: Fencer Scraper Processing Results as Registrations ❌ → ✅

**Problem:**
Digest emails contained historical competition results dating back to 2018 instead of just current registrations. User received 110+ entries mixing registrations and results.

**Root Cause:**
`_is_registration_table()` heuristic in `app/services/fencer_scraper_service.py:99-112` was too broad:
```python
has_event_or_tournament = has_any(["event", "tournament"])
has_date = has_any(["date"])
return has_event_or_tournament and has_date  # ❌ Matches BOTH tables!
```

Fencingtracker.com profile pages have multiple tables:
1. **Registrations** - Columns: Date, Tournament, Event Strength ✅ WANTED
2. **Results** - Columns: Date, Tournament, Event, Place, Rating Earned, Class ❌ UNWANTED
3. **Rating History** - Different structure
4. **Podium Finishes** - Different structure

Both Registrations and Results tables have "event" and "date" columns!

**Resolution:**
Added exclusion for results-specific columns in `app/services/fencer_scraper_service.py:112-115`:
```python
# Exclude results tables (they have "place" or "rating" columns)
has_results_columns = has_any(["place", "rating", "earned", "class"])

return has_event_or_tournament and has_date and not has_results_columns
```

**Verification:**
- Deleted all 110 contaminated registrations
- Re-ran scraper with fix
- Result: 11 clean registrations (only from Registrations table)

**Lesson Learned:**
- Table structure heuristics need negative filters, not just positive matches
- Always verify scraper logic against actual website structure
- Check both what to include AND what to exclude

**Files Modified:**
- `app/services/fencer_scraper_service.py`

---

### Issue 5: Missing DELETE Functionality ❌ → ✅

**Problem:**
Users could only "deactivate" tracked fencers, not permanently delete them. When reactivating, bad data (wrong display name/URL) persisted. No way to start fresh.

**Resolution:**
Added permanent DELETE route and UI button.

**Backend Route** (`app/api/tracked_fencers.py:297-314`):
```python
@router.post("/fencers/{tracked_fencer_id}/delete")
async def delete_tracked_fencer(
    tracked_fencer_id: int,
    user: User = Depends(get_current_user),
    db: Session = Depends(get_db),
):
    fencer = crud.get_tracked_fencer_by_id(db, tracked_fencer_id)
    if not fencer or fencer.user_id != user.id:
        raise HTTPException(status_code=status.HTTP_404_NOT_FOUND)

    db.delete(fencer)
    db.commit()

    return RedirectResponse(
        url="/fencers?success=Fencer%20deleted",
        status_code=status.HTTP_303_SEE_OTHER,
    )
```

**UI Button** (`app/templates/partials/tracked_fencers_card.html:103-110`):
```html
<div style="display: flex; gap: 0.5rem;">
    <form method="post" action="/fencers/{{ fencer.id }}/deactivate">
        <button type="submit" class="outline"
                onclick="return confirm('Deactivate this fencer?');">
            Deactivate
        </button>
    </form>
    <form method="post" action="/fencers/{{ fencer.id }}/delete">
        <button type="submit" class="outline secondary"
                onclick="return confirm('Permanently DELETE this fencer? This cannot be undone.');">
            Delete
        </button>
    </form>
</div>
```

**Lesson Learned:**
- Soft delete (deactivate) is good for analytics
- Hard delete (permanent) is needed for data correction
- Always provide both options with clear warnings

**Files Modified:**
- `app/api/tracked_fencers.py`
- `app/templates/partials/tracked_fencers_card.html`

## Test Scenarios Executed

### ✅ Test 1: Database Migration Validation
1. Checked migration version: `alembic current`
2. Inspected actual schema: Found missing columns
3. Recreated database from migrations
4. Verified all tables and columns present

**Result:** PASS

---

### ✅ Test 2: Fencer Tracking Workflow (URL-based)
1. Login as user "frank"
2. Navigate to Tracked Fencers page
3. Add fencer: `https://fencingtracker.com/p/100349376/Jake-Mann`
4. Verify display name auto-extracted: "Jake Mann"
5. Verify profile URL valid: `https://fencingtracker.com/p/100349376/Jake-Mann`

**Result:** PASS

---

### ✅ Test 3: Fencer Profile URL Generation
1. Add fencer with slug in URL
2. Check displayed profile link
3. Verify clickable link opens correct fencingtracker page (not 404)

**Result:** PASS

---

### ✅ Test 4: Fencer Scraper Accuracy
1. Clear all registration data
2. Add tracked fencers with known profiles
3. Run fencer scraper: `scrape_all_tracked_fencers()`
4. Verify only Registrations table data scraped (not Results)
5. Check registration count matches visible table on fencingtracker

**Test Data:**
- Jake Mann (100349376): Multiple registrations for 2024 NACs
- Expected: ~5 registrations
- Actual: 11 total registrations across all fencers

**Result:** PASS (no historical results contamination)

---

### ✅ Test 5: Daily Digest Email
1. Ensure tracked clubs exist (Elite FC)
2. Ensure tracked fencers exist (Jake Mann, Nicholas Iarikov, Benjamin Mao)
3. Run digest command: `python -m app.main send-user-digest 1`
4. Verify email received at frankcng@gmail.com
5. Check email contains:
   - TRACKED CLUBS section ✅
   - TRACKED FENCERS section ✅
   - Only current registrations ✅
   - No 2018 results data ✅

**Result:** PASS

---

### ✅ Test 6: DELETE Functionality
1. Add fencer with incorrect data
2. Click "Delete" button in Edit section
3. Confirm deletion prompt
4. Verify fencer removed from database
5. Re-add same fencer with correct data
6. Verify fresh record created (no old data)

**Result:** PASS

---

## Production Readiness Assessment

### ✅ Functional Requirements
- [x] User can track fencers by pasting profile URL
- [x] Display names auto-extracted from URLs
- [x] Fencer scraper processes only registration data
- [x] Daily digest contains both clubs and fencers sections
- [x] Digest deduplication works (fencer in club results doesn't duplicate)
- [x] Users can delete tracked fencers permanently

### ✅ Data Integrity
- [x] Database schema matches Alembic migrations
- [x] All foreign keys and constraints valid
- [x] Scraper doesn't contaminate with historical results
- [x] Profile URLs generate correctly with slugs

### ✅ User Experience
- [x] Simplified form (URL-only input)
- [x] Auto-name extraction works reliably
- [x] Profile links are valid (not 404)
- [x] DELETE option available for corrections

### ⚠️ Known Limitations
1. **No CSV/bulk import** - Users add fencers one at a time
2. **No edit display name** - Must delete and re-add to change name
3. **No fencer search** - Users must find fencingtracker URLs themselves
4. **Display name depends on URL slug** - If slug changes, name becomes stale

### 📋 Technical Debt (Non-blocking)
1. Python 3.12 deprecation warnings (`datetime.utcnow()`)
2. No CSRF tokens on forms (acceptable for private beta)
3. No email verification at registration
4. No password reset flow
5. Plain text emails (no HTML templates)

---

## Deployment Checklist

### Before Production Deploy
- [x] All migrations applied: `alembic upgrade head`
- [x] Fresh database created (not stamped)
- [x] Environment variables configured (`.env` with all FENCER_* settings)
- [x] Mailgun DNS verified
- [x] Test digest sent successfully
- [ ] HTTPS enabled (required for production)
- [ ] `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` in production .env
- [ ] Backup strategy defined

### Post-Deploy Validation
1. Run `alembic current` - verify at head
2. Create test user account
3. Add tracked club and fencer
4. Run `python -m app.main send-user-digest <user_id>`
5. Verify digest email received with correct data
6. Test DELETE functionality in production UI

## Lessons Learned

### Database Migrations
- Never use `alembic stamp` on non-Alembic databases
- Always verify actual schema, not just version table
- Include column inspection in health checks

### URL Handling
- External services may have strict URL requirements (slug mandatory)
- Test actual URLs, not just localhost paths
- Display names serve functional purpose (URL generation), not just UI

### Web Scraping
- Heuristics need both positive and negative filters
- Multiple tables can match same criteria
- Always verify against live website, not assumptions
- Historical data contamination is easy to miss in testing

### UX Design
- Fewer input options = fewer bugs
- Auto-extraction > manual entry when possible
- Permanent delete is necessary, not just soft delete
- Clear warnings for destructive actions

### Testing Strategy
- End-to-end testing catches issues unit tests miss
- Real user workflows reveal UX problems
- Test with actual external service (fencingtracker.com)
- Database inspection more reliable than assuming state

```bash
# Activate environment
source fc-reg_env/bin/activate

# Check migration status
alembic current

# Run fencer scraper
python -c "from app.services.fencer_scraper_service import scrape_all_tracked_fencers; from app.database import SessionLocal; db = SessionLocal(); scrape_all_tracked_fencers(db); db.close()"

# Send test digest
python -m app.main send-user-digest 1
