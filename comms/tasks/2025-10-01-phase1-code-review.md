---

## Requirements Verification

### ✅ Database Schema
- [x] `users` table with all required fields
- [x] `user_sessions` table for session management
- [x] `tracked_clubs` table with unique constraint on (user_id, club_url)
- [x] Proper foreign key relationships with CASCADE deletes
- [x] `club_url` field added to `registrations` table for digest queries
- [x] `is_active` field on users for account management

**Notes:**
- Schema includes `is_active` on User model (enhancement beyond spec)
- All indexes properly configured for performance

### ✅ Authentication System
- [x] Bcrypt password hashing implemented with PBKDF2 fallback

- Graceful fallback to PBKDF2 if bcrypt not available
- `SESSION_COOKIE_NAME = "session_token"`
- HTTP-only, SameSite=lax cookies
- Secure flag configurable via `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` env var

### ✅ API Endpoints

#### Authentication Routes (`app/api/auth.py`)
- [x] `GET /register` - Registration page
- [x] `POST /auth/register` - User registration (form + JSON)
- [x] `GET /login` - Login page
- [x] `POST /auth/login` - User login (form + JSON)
- [x] `POST /auth/logout` - Logout and clear session
- [x] `GET /auth/me` - Get current user info

#### Club Management Routes (`app/api/clubs.py`)
- [x] `GET /clubs` - List tracked clubs page
- [x] `POST /clubs/add` - Add new tracked club (form + JSON)
- [x] `PATCH /clubs/{id}` - Update tracked club (JSON only)
- [x] `DELETE /clubs/{id}` - Remove (soft-delete) tracked club

**Enhanced Features:**
- Club URL validation via `club_validation_service.py`
- Automatic club name detection from fencingtracker.com
- Weapon filter normalization
- Re-activation of previously deactivated clubs

#### Admin Routes (`app/api/admin.py`)
- [x] `GET /admin/users` - Admin panel (HTML)
- [x] `PATCH /admin/users/{id}` - Update user (is_admin, is_active)

**Security:**
- Admin routes protected by `require_admin` dependency
- Prevents admin from deactivating themselves
- Proper 403 Forbidden responses for non-admins

### ✅ Web UI Templates

Templates found in `app/templates/`:
- [x] `base.html` - Base layout with navigation
- [x] `register.html` - User registration form
- [x] `login.html` - Login form
- [x] `dashboard.html` - User dashboard with stats
- [x] `tracked_clubs.html` - Club management interface
- [x] `admin/users.html` - Admin user management panel

**UI Features:**
- Navigation shows Login/Register when not authenticated
- Navigation shows Dashboard/Clubs/Logout when authenticated
- Admin link visible only to admins
- Error message display on all forms
- Success message on registration redirect
- Weapon filter checkboxes (foil, epee, saber)
- Active/inactive club sections

### ✅ Notification System

#### Daily Digest Service (`app/services/digest_service.py`)
- [x] `send_daily_digests()` - Send to all active users
- [x] `send_user_digest(db, user)` - Send to single user
- [x] `apply_weapon_filter()` - Filter by weapon preference
- [x] `format_digest_email()` - Plain-text email formatting

**Digest Logic:**
- Looks back 24 hours for new registrations
- Groups by tracked club
- Applies per-club weapon filters
- Skips email if no new registrations (configurable)
- Includes club name, fencer, events, tournament
- Plain-text format with clear sections

#### Admin Notifications
- [x] `notify_admin_new_user()` in `auth_service.py`
- Uses `ADMIN_EMAIL` env var or falls back to first `MAILGUN_DEFAULT_RECIPIENTS`
- Best-effort (doesn't block registration if email fails)

### ✅ CLI Commands

## Deployment Readiness

### Production Requirements Checklist

#### Infrastructure
- [ ] Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` in production `.env`
- [ ] Configure HTTPS (required for secure cookies)
- [ ] Set up process manager (systemd/supervisord) for 3 processes:
  - FastAPI web app
  - Scraper scheduler
  - Digest scheduler
- [ ] Configure SQLite WAL mode for multi-process access
- [ ] Set up log rotation
- [ ] Configure firewall rules

#### Configuration
- [x] Mailgun credentials verified (DNS records propagated)
- [ ] Set `ADMIN_EMAIL` to real admin address
- [ ] Review `SCRAPER_CLUB_URLS` for production clubs
- [ ] Adjust `SCRAPER_INTERVAL_MINUTES` if needed (currently 720 = 12 hours)

#### Database
- [ ] Run `python -m app.main db-init`
- [ ] Create admin account: `python -m app.main create-admin`
- [ ] Backup strategy for `fc_registration.db`

#### Testing
- [ ] Send test email: `python -m app.main send-test-email`
- [ ] Register test user and verify admin notification received
- [ ] Add test club and verify scraping works
- [ ] Manually trigger digest: `python -m app.main send-user-digest 1`
- [ ] Verify all 3 processes can run concurrently

---

## Known Limitations (As Designed)

Per spec, these are **intentionally deferred** to future phases:

1. No fencer profile tracking (Phase 2)
2. No automated data cleanup (Phase 3)
3. Plain-text emails only (HTML in Phase 4)
4. No password reset (admin must reset manually)
5. No email verification on signup
6. No rate limiting on login
7. System-wide digest time (9:00 AM, not per-user)

---

## Security Audit Summary

### ✅ Authentication & Authorization
- Proper password hashing (bcrypt with fallback)
- Session tokens cryptographically random (32 bytes)
- Session expiry enforced
- Admin-only routes protected
- Active user status checked on login

### ✅ Data Protection
- HTTP-only cookies prevent XSS
- SameSite=lax prevents CSRF (with caveats)
- Secure flag configurable for HTTPS
- Password confirmation on admin creation

### ⚠️ Areas to Monitor
- No CSRF tokens (acceptable with SameSite for now)
- No rate limiting (private beta acceptable)
- No email verification (trust model for private beta)

**Overall Security Grade:** B+ (appropriate for private beta)

---

## Performance Considerations

### Database Queries
- [x] Indexes on foreign keys (user_id, club_url)
- [x] Unique constraints prevent duplicates
- [x] `joinedload()` for N+1 prevention
- [x] Date-based filtering for digest queries

### Scalability Notes
- SQLite suitable for private beta (<100 users)
- Current design supports ~1000 registrations/day
- Digest generation scales linearly with user count
- Consider PostgreSQL for >50 active users

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Before Production)
1. Set `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE=true` in production
2. Configure HTTPS
3. Create admin account
4. Test full flow end-to-end with real Mailgun

### Short-term (Phase 1.5 - Optional)
1. Add CSRF tokens to forms
2. Fix deprecation warnings (datetime.utcnow)
3. Add email format validation
4. Update SQLAlchemy to 2.0 pattern

### Medium-term (Phase 2-4)
1. Implement fencer tracking (Phase 2)
2. Add data cleanup automation (Phase 3)
3. HTML email templates (Phase 4)
4. Password reset flow (Phase 4)
