# PR: Feature - Phase 2 Completion (Fencer Tracking)

**Closes:** #issue-number-here
**Related Docs:** [Project Roadmap](docs/ROADMAP.md)

## Summary

This pull request marks the completion of **Phase 2: Fencer Profile Tracking**. The core functionality allowing users to track individual fencers by their `fencingtracker.com` ID and receive notifications about their tournament registrations is now fully implemented.

This work builds upon the multi-user foundation from Phase 1, adding the second major tracking capability to the platform and significantly enhancing its value to users.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Backend & API
-   **Database Schema:**
    -   Introduced the `tracked_fencers` table to associate fencers with users.
    -   Added `fencingtracker_id` to the `fencers` table for stable identification.
    -   Added cache and failure-tracking fields (`last_scraped_at`, `scrape_failures`) to `tracked_fencers` to manage scrape frequency and reliability.
    -   All schema changes are managed via Alembic migrations (`fea59cc0d5fd`, `2ba564e47b5d`, `f8a8c6bdf3d7`).
-   **Fencer Scraping Service (`fencer_scraper_service.py`):**
    -   A new, dedicated service scrapes fencer profile pages from `fencingtracker.com`.
    -   Implements a polite scraping strategy with configurable delays, jitter, and a failure cooldown mechanism to avoid overwhelming the target site.
-   **Digest & Notification Service (`digest_service.py`):**
    -   The daily digest generation logic has been updated to include a "Tracked Fencers" section.
    -   Correctly de-duplicates registrations to ensure a fencer's registration only appears once, even if they belong to a tracked club.
-   **API Endpoints (`tracked_fencers.py`):**
    -   New endpoints to `add`, `update`, and `deactivate` tracked fencers for the currently authenticated user.
    -   Includes server-side validation of Fencer IDs using `fencer_validation_service.py`.
-   **CRUD Layer (`crud.py`):**
    -   Expanded with new functions to manage `TrackedFencer` entities.

### 2. Frontend & UI
-   **Dashboard Integration:**
    -   The main dashboard now includes a "Tracked Fencers" card (`partials/tracked_fencers_card.html`).
-   **Fencer Management Page (`tracked_fencers.html`):**
    -   A new dedicated page at `/fencers` allows users to view, add, and manage their tracked fencers.
    -   Users can add a fencer by their numeric ID and optionally provide a display name and weapon filters.

### 3. Testing
-   **Expanded Test Suite:**
    -   Added comprehensive tests for the new functionality, including:
        -   CRUD operations for tracked fencers (`test_crud_tracked_fencers.py`).
        -   API route validation and behavior (`test_tracked_fencer_routes.py`).
        -   Fencer scraper logic and validation services (`test_fencer_scraper_service.py`, `test_fencer_validation_service.py`).

## How to Test

1.  **Log in** to the application.
2.  Navigate to the **Dashboard** and locate the "Tracked Fencers" card, or go directly to the `/fencers` page.
3.  **Add a fencer:**
    -   Find a fencer's profile on `fencingtracker.com` (e.g., `https://www.fencingtracker.com/p/12345`).
    -   Enter the numeric ID (`12345`) into the "Fencer ID" field.
    -   Optionally add a display name and select weapon filters.
    -   Click "Save".
4.  **Verify:** The fencer should appear in the list of tracked fencers.
5.  **Trigger a digest:** Run the `send-user-digest` command for your user ID to confirm that new registrations for the tracked fencer appear correctly in the email.
    ```bash
    python -m app.main send-user-digest <your_user_id>
    ```
6.  **Deactivate a fencer:** Click the "Deactivate" button next to a tracked fencer and confirm they are moved to the inactive list.

## Next Steps

With Phase 2 complete, the project is now ready to move on to **Phase 3: Data Cleanup Automation** and **Phase 4: Enhanced Email Templates & Polish** as outlined in the roadmap.
