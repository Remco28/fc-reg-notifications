# Security Features Testing Guide

This guide walks you through manually testing the CSRF protection and rate limiting features implemented in the security hardening phase.

---

## Prerequisites

1. **Server Running:**
   ```bash
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

2. **Admin User Created:**
   ```bash
   python -m app.main create-admin frank frank@example.com
   # Enter password when prompted
   ```

3. **Browser with DevTools:**
   - Chrome/Edge: F12 or Ctrl+Shift+I
   - Firefox: F12 or Ctrl+Shift+K

## Part 1: CSRF Protection Testing

CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tokens prevent attackers from tricking your browser into performing actions you didn't intend.

### Test 1: CSRF Token Present in Forms

**What to test:** All state-changing forms include a hidden CSRF token.

**Steps:**
1. Open browser to `http://localhost:8000/login`
2. Right-click on the page → "Inspect" or press F12
3. In DevTools, go to the **Elements** tab
4. Find the login form in the HTML
5. Look for a hidden input field like this:
   ```html
   <input type="hidden" name="csrf_token" value="abc123...">
   ```

**Expected Result:** ✅ Hidden CSRF token field is present with a long random value (64 characters)

**Test on these pages:**
- `/login` - Login form
- `/register` - Registration form
- `/clubs` - Add club form
- `/fencers` - Add fencer form

---

### Test 2: Valid CSRF Token Allows Action

**What to test:** Normal form submissions work with valid CSRF tokens.

**Steps:**
1. Go to `http://localhost:8000/login`
2. Enter your admin username and password
3. Click "Log in"

**Expected Result:** ✅ You are logged in and redirected to `/dashboard`

**Why it works:** The browser automatically sends the CSRF token from the hidden field, and the server validates it against your session.

---

### Test 3: Missing CSRF Token Blocks Action

**What to test:** Requests without CSRF tokens are rejected.

**Steps:**
1. Open DevTools (F12) → Go to **Console** tab
2. Make sure you're logged in (visit `/dashboard` to confirm)
3. Paste this code into the console and press Enter:
   ```javascript
   // Attempt to logout without CSRF token
   fetch('/auth/logout', {
     method: 'POST',
     credentials: 'include'
   }).then(r => r.text()).then(console.log);
   ```

**Expected Result:** ✅ You should see an error response (403 Forbidden or redirect to error page)

**Expected Output in Console:**
```
403 Forbidden
{"detail": "Invalid CSRF token"}
```

**Why it fails:** The request doesn't include the CSRF token, so the server rejects it.

---

### Test 4: Invalid CSRF Token Blocks Action

**What to test:** Requests with wrong CSRF tokens are rejected.

**Steps:**
1. Open DevTools → **Console** tab
2. Paste this code:
   ```javascript
   // Attempt to add a club with fake CSRF token
   fetch('/clubs/add', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded' },
     credentials: 'include',
     body: 'club_url=https://fencingtracker.com/club/test&csrf_token=FAKE_TOKEN_12345'
   }).then(r => r.text()).then(console.log);
   ```

**Expected Result:** ✅ Request rejected with 403 error

**Expected Console Output:**
```
403 Forbidden
{"detail": "Invalid CSRF token"}
```

---

### Test 5: CSRF Token in AJAX/Fetch Requests

**What to test:** JavaScript can include CSRF tokens via headers.

**Steps:**
1. Log in to your account
2. Go to `/clubs` (tracked clubs page)
3. Open DevTools → **Console** tab
4. Get your CSRF token first:
   ```javascript
   // Extract CSRF token from a form on the page
   const csrfToken = document.querySelector('input[name="csrf_token"]').value;
   console.log('CSRF Token:', csrfToken);
   ```
5. Now make a legitimate request with the token:
   ```javascript
   // This should work - includes valid CSRF token
   fetch('/clubs/add', {
     method: 'POST',
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       'X-CSRF-Token': csrfToken
     },
     credentials: 'include',
     body: JSON.stringify({
       club_url: 'https://fencingtracker.com/club/100261977/Elite-Fencing-Club',
       club_name: 'Test Club'
     })
   }).then(r => r.json()).then(console.log);
   ```

**Expected Result:** ✅ Club is added successfully (you'll see club data in console)

**Expected Console Output:**
```javascript
{
  id: 1,
  club_url: "https://fencingtracker.com/club/100261977/Elite-Fencing-Club",
  club_name: "Test Club",
  weapon_filter: null,
  active: true,
  created_at: "2025-10-03T..."
}
```

## Part 2: Rate Limiting Testing

Rate limiting prevents brute-force attacks by blocking too many failed login attempts.

### Test 6: Login Rate Limit - Under Threshold

**What to test:** Normal failed logins work (under 5 attempts).

**Steps:**
1. Log out if you're logged in (click logout button)
2. Go to `http://localhost:8000/login`
3. Try to log in with **wrong password** - do this **4 times**
   - Username: `frank`
   - Password: `wrongpassword123`

**Expected Result:** ✅ All 4 attempts show "Invalid credentials" error

**Why it works:** You're under the 5-attempt limit within 5 minutes.

---

### Test 7: Login Rate Limit - Exceeded

**What to test:** 6th failed login is blocked with rate limit error.

**Steps:**
1. Continue from Test 6 (you've already failed 4 times)
2. Try to log in with wrong password **2 more times** (attempts 5 and 6)

**Expected Result on 5th attempt:** ✅ "Invalid credentials" error (still allowed)

**Expected Result on 6th attempt:** ✅ **429 Rate Limit Error**

**Expected Error Message:**
```
Too many login attempts. Try again in X seconds.
```

**Why it's blocked:** You exceeded 5 failed attempts within 5 minutes for username "frank".

---

### Test 8: Rate Limit Resets After Successful Login

**What to test:** Successful login clears the rate limit counter.

**Steps:**
1. Wait for the error message to show retry time, or just wait 5 minutes
2. Alternatively, test with a different username that hasn't been rate-limited
3. Log in with **correct password**
4. Log out
5. Try logging in with **wrong password** 5 more times

**Expected Result:** ✅ You can fail 5 times again before being blocked (counter was reset by successful login)

---

### Test 9: Registration Rate Limit - By IP Address

**What to test:** Too many registration attempts from same IP are blocked.

**Steps:**
1. Open an **Incognito/Private window** (Ctrl+Shift+N in Chrome)
2. Go to `http://localhost:8000/register`
3. Try to register **3 different accounts** (use different usernames/emails each time):
   - Attempt 1: `testuser1` / `test1@example.com` / `password123`
   - Attempt 2: `testuser2` / `test2@example.com` / `password123`
   - Attempt 3: `testuser3` / `test3@example.com` / `password123`

**Expected Result:** First 3 registrations succeed

4. Try to register a **4th account**:
   - `testuser4` / `test4@example.com` / `password123`

**Expected Result:** ✅ **429 Rate Limit Error**

**Expected Error Message:**
```
Too many registration attempts. Try again in X seconds.
```

**Why it's blocked:** Registration is limited to 3 attempts per hour per IP address.

---

### Test 10: Different IPs Have Separate Rate Limits

**What to test:** Rate limits are tracked per IP, not globally.

**Note:** This is hard to test locally without multiple machines or VPN. For manual testing:

**Steps:**
1. If you have a VPN, connect to it (changes your IP)
2. Try to register again
3. Should work even if your original IP is rate-limited

**Alternative (Advanced):** Use `curl` with `X-Forwarded-For` header:
```bash
# Simulate request from different IP
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/auth/register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-Forwarded-For: 192.168.1.100" \
  -d '{"username":"testuser5","email":"test5@example.com","password":"password123"}'
```

**Expected Result:** ✅ Registration succeeds because it's treated as a different IP

---

## Part 3: Integration Testing

### Test 11: CSRF + Rate Limit Together

**What to test:** Both protections work simultaneously.

**Steps:**
1. Open DevTools → **Console** tab
2. Try to brute-force login via JavaScript (bypasses CSRF):
   ```javascript
   // This should fail due to missing CSRF token
   for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
     fetch('/auth/login', {
       method: 'POST',
       headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
       credentials: 'include',
       body: JSON.stringify({ username: 'frank', password: 'wrong' + i })
     }).then(r => r.text()).then(t => console.log(`Attempt ${i+1}:`, t));
   }
   ```

**Expected Result:** ✅ Requests are blocked by rate limiting (429 errors after 5 attempts)

**Note:** Even though CSRF tokens are bypassed for login (by design - see spec), rate limiting still protects against brute force.

---

## Part 4: Automated Tests

### Test 12: Run the Full Test Suite

**What to test:** All security tests pass.

**Steps:**
```bash
# Run all CSRF tests
pytest tests/test_csrf_protection.py -v

# Run all rate limiting tests
pytest tests/test_rate_limiting.py -v

# Run all tests
pytest -v
```

**Expected Result:** ✅ All security tests pass (some route tests may fail due to test fixture issues - that's a known issue)

**Key Tests to Check:**
- `test_csrf_token_generated_on_session_creation` - CSRF tokens created with sessions
- `test_csrf_token_validation_failure_missing` - Missing tokens rejected
- `test_login_rate_limit_blocks_over_threshold` - Login brute-force blocked
- `test_register_rate_limit_by_ip` - Registration spam blocked

---

## Part 5: Cleanup

### After Testing

1. **Delete test users:**
   ```bash
   # Connect to database
   python3 -c "
   import sqlite3
   conn = sqlite3.connect('fc_registration.db')
   cursor = conn.cursor()
   cursor.execute('DELETE FROM users WHERE username LIKE \"testuser%\"')
   conn.commit()
   print(f'Deleted {cursor.rowcount} test users')
   conn.close()
   "
   ```

2. **Reset rate limit counters:**
   - Rate limits are in-memory, so just restart the server:
   ```bash
   # Press Ctrl+C to stop uvicorn, then restart:
   uvicorn app.main:app --reload
   ```

## Understanding the Security Features

### How CSRF Tokens Work

1. **Session Creation:** When you log in, the server generates a random CSRF token and stores it in your session (database)
2. **Token Delivery:** The token is embedded in every form as a hidden field
3. **Token Validation:** When you submit a form, the server compares the submitted token with the one in your session
4. **Attack Prevention:** An attacker on another website can't get your CSRF token, so they can't forge requests

**Visual Flow:**
```
User logs in → Server creates session + CSRF token → Token stored in DB
                                                    ↓
User loads form page → Server embeds token in HTML → Browser renders form
                                                    ↓
User submits form → Browser sends token + cookies → Server validates token
                                                    ↓
Token matches session? → YES: Allow action
                      → NO: Reject (403 Forbidden)
```

### How Rate Limiting Works

1. **Tracking:** Server keeps a list of recent attempts per username (login) or IP (registration)
2. **Sliding Window:** Only attempts within the time window count (5 min for login, 1 hour for registration)
3. **Threshold:** After N attempts, requests are blocked
4. **Reset:** Successful login clears the counter, or wait for window to expire

**Visual Flow:**
```
Login attempt → Check: attempts for "frank" in last 5 minutes
                      ↓
              < 5 attempts? → Process login
                            → If success: clear counter
                            → If fail: add to counter
                      ↓
              ≥ 5 attempts? → Return 429 (Too Many Requests)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "CSRF token missing" on every request
- **Cause:** Session not being created or stored
- **Fix:** Check that you're logged in (visit `/dashboard`)
- **Fix:** Clear browser cookies and log in again

### Rate limit doesn't reset
- **Cause:** In-memory storage persists until server restart
- **Fix:** Wait for the time window to expire (5 min for login, 1 hour for registration)
- **Fix:** Restart the server to clear all rate limit counters

### Can't test registration rate limit
- **Cause:** Same username can't register twice
- **Fix:** Use different usernames for each attempt (`testuser1`, `testuser2`, etc.)

### Tests fail but manual testing works
- **Cause:** Known issue with test fixtures (database session isolation)
- **Fix:** Routes work correctly in production; test setup needs fixing (non-blocking issue)

## Security Best Practices Verified

✅ **CSRF Protection:**
- All state-changing routes (POST/PATCH/DELETE) require CSRF tokens
- Tokens are session-specific and unpredictable
- Constant-time comparison prevents timing attacks

✅ **Rate Limiting:**
- Login: 5 attempts per 5 minutes per username
- Registration: 3 attempts per hour per IP
- Successful login resets counter
- 429 status code with Retry-After header

✅ **Defense in Depth:**
- SameSite cookies (prevents CSRF via cookie alone)
- HTTP-only cookies (prevents JavaScript theft)
- CSRF tokens (additional layer)
- Rate limiting (prevents brute force)

## Next Steps

After validating all tests pass:
1. Document any issues found in `comms/log.md`
2. Request architect code review of implementation
3. Archive the security hardening spec after review approval
4. Update production deployment checklist with security verification steps
